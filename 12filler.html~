      <h1>Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial?</h1>
	<p>Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. I can explain. It's very valuable. You're going back for the Countess, aren't you?</p>
	<p>Fry!  Quit doing the right thing, you jerk!  Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex.  Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence? <strong> I just want to talk.</strong> <em> It has nothing to do with mating.</em>  Fry, that doesn't make sense.</p>
	<h2>Hey, guess what you're accessories to.</h2>
	<p>Can we have Bender Burgers again? Well, then good news! It's a suppository. She also liked to shut up! They're like sex, except I'm having them! Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court!</p><br>

	<ol><li>I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want!</li><li>Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged.</li><li>Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?</li></ol><h3>Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most.</h3><p>Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them? Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say.</p><ul><li>Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy.</li><li>Actually, that's still true.</li><li>WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT!</li></ul><p>And I'm his friend Jesus. You know, I was God once. You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long. I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians.</p><p>It doesn't look so shiny to me. Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing. Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso! No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own!</p><p>I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso! But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver.</p><p>Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there! Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor.</p><p>Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets?</p><p>Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack!  I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff! They're like sex, except I'm having them! I just told you! You've killed me! Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil.  And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil.  And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.</p><p>Daylight and everything. No! Don't jump! Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. Is the Space Pope reptilian!?</p><p>I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared… Large bet on myself in round one. Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver.</p><p>I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. Really?! Hello, little man. I will destroy you! What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso! Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them.</p><p>Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. Is that a cooking show? I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense. If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right.</p><p>I don't want to be rescued. Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments." You don't know how to do any of those. I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared…</p>
